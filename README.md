# random-recipe-generator

This app uses the TheMealDB (www.themealdb.com) free meal API to generate a random recipe for the user.

On the homepage, the user will choose whether they want to generate a recipe for breakfast, starter, entr√©e, side, or dessert. Once they click the button that says "Generate recipe!", they are taken to a page with a random recipe from the category of their choice. 

On the resulting page there is a picture of the recipe, ingredients, instructions, and information about the origin and category. At the bottom of this page, there is a button that will allow them to generate a new recipe of the same category. The top of the page has a link that will take them back to the homepage.
